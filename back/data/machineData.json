  {"name": "ab crunch", "img":  "data/nelsonMachines/abCrunch.png", "instructions":  "Select a light resistance and sit down on the ab machine placing your feet under the pads provided and grabbing the top handles. Your arms should be bent at a 90 degree angle as you rest the triceps on the pads provided. This will be your starting position.\nAt the same time, begin to lift the legs up as you crunch your upper torso. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Be sure to use a slow and controlled motion. Concentrate on using your abs to move the weight while relaxing your legs and feet.\nAfter a second pause, slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.", "muscles":  ["abdominal"]},

It often has a triangle handle, but it may be a bar. Position yourself with your knees slightly bent, so you have to reach to grab the handle with outstretched arms without curling the lower back over. Brace the abdominals, and you're ready to row.\nPull the handle and weight back toward the lower abdomen while trying not to use the momentum of the row too much by moving the torso backward with the arms.\nTarget the middle to upper back by keeping your back straight and squeezing your shoulder blades together as you row, keeping your chest out.\nReturn the handle forward under tension to full stretch, remembering to keep that back straight even though flexed at the hips.

The pedals may start to move as you do and it can be easy to lose your balance. Grab the handlebars as you step on to help you stay balanced. \nBegin pedaling to turn it on. Taking a few steps forward on the machine should power up the display. If not, look for a start button. \nStart pedaling at an even pace. Your arms should be swinging with the handles. When your left foot goes down, straightening your leg, the right handle should be pulled toward your body. Same for when your right leg goes down.Do not lock your knees. Keep the knees slightly bent when straightening the leg on each stroke. Notice that it is similar to riding a bike without ever sitting down, but with less of an up and down range of motion. Faster is not always better on the elliptical machine. Turning up the resistance will make it so that you have to push harder on the pedals which will give your muscles a better work out.", "muscles":  ["hamstrings", "glutes", "calves", "quads", "chest", "abdominals"]},

Other positions and grips are possible but start with this standard position.\nPull the bar down until it's approximately level with the chin. Exhale on the downward motion. While shifting slightly backward is OK, aim to keep your upper torso stationary. Keep your feet flat on the floor and engage your abs as you pull. The bottom of the motion should be where your elbows can't move downward anymore without moving backward. Be sure to stop at that point and do not go lower.\nSqueeze the shoulder blades together while maintaining square shoulders.\nFrom the bottom position, with the bar close to your chin, slowly return the bar to the starting position while controlling its gradual ascent.
